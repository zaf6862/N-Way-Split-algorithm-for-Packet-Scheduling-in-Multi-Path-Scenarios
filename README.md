# N-Way-Split-algorithm-for-Packet-Scheduling-in-Multi-Path-Scenarios
A simple algorithm for scheduling a fixed size data chunk onto multiple paths available. 
This scheduler has the property that under the assumption that all the paths have same and 
consistent parameters (e.g. bandwidth, one-way delay) and no packet loss, this algorithm will 
finish the transmission on all paths at the same time.
